# 15-Puzzle-Game
A Java Project of the 15 Puzzle Game
The basic idea of the 15 puzzle is that numbered tiles can be swapped with the blank
spot one at a time. After a series of these swaps, a solved puzzle should have all of the
tiles in order from lowest number to highest number with the blank spot in the upper left
corner. In the algorithm given to you, the zero represents the blank spot.
